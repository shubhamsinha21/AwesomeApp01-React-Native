**Learning React Native**

This app consists of two sections -:

I made a basic Hello World React Native Application. Then i learned some more stuffs and finally created a basic UI. 
The components of React Native I learned are-
View, Text, ScrollView, SafeAreaView, Buttons, TouchableOpacity, Stylesheet.

I also learned the installation process of React Native , which i believe the toughest part for me till now.

**Required for running react-native-app on your pc -**

i. Install Vs Code

ii. Install Chocolatey using command prompt, just search on google.

iii. using choco... command ( see react-native docs installation) install jdk using command prompt.

iv. Download Android studio 👍. Install all the relevant packages by default. It will install android adb manager by default, etc.

v. Now, Open Vs code -> terminal -> run this cmd ( npx react-native@latest init **projectName** ). It will install the required packages and creates the folder structure.

vi. We are all done now 😄. In order to run your app, Connect your device ( mobile phone ) using USB cable, the device here acts as emulator.

vii. It will take some time for set-up and installation of androidDebugger on your phone. Here, is the result. 🎉
