**Learning React Native**

This app consists of two sections -:

I made a basic Hello World React Native Application. Then i learned some more stuffs and finally created a basic UI. 
The components of React Native I learned are-
View, Text, ScrollView, SafeAreaView, Buttons, TouchableOpacity, Stylesheet.

I also learned the installation process of React Native , which i believe the toughest part for me till now.
